## 5. Technical Guidelines and Methodology
### 5.1. Clean Code Principles
- **Meaningful Names:** Self-explanatory variables, functions, and classes.  
- **Well-Defined Functions:** Small functions that perform only one task.  
- **Comments Only When Necessary:** Clarify non-obvious intentions in code.  
- **Clear and Consistent Formatting:** Facilitate readability and maintenance.  
- **Clean Error Handling:** Separate main logic from error handling.

### 5.2. SOLID Principles
- **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):** Each module or class should have a single responsibility.  
- **OCP (Open/Closed Principle):** Extend, but do not modify existing classes.  
- **LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle):** Ensure subclasses can replace their superclasses without issues.  
- **ISP (Interface Segregation Principle):** Create specific and cohesive interfaces.  
- **DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle):** Depend on abstractions, not implementations.

### 5.3. Work Methodology
- **Detailed Contextual Analysis:** Review all files and dependencies relevant to the task.  
- **Step-by-Step Plan:** Develop a detailed plan for each modification, justifying each step based on Clean Code, SOLID, and best practices.  
- **Request for Approval:** Present the detailed plan to the user and await confirmation before executing modifications.  
- **Proactivity:** Identify opportunities for improvement beyond the immediate scope, suggesting refactorings and adjustments that increase the quality and sustainability of the project.
